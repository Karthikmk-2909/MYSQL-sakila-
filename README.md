🎉 Excited to Share My Latest Project on SQL with the Sakila Dataset! 🎉

I recently completed a comprehensive project where I got to dive deep into the Sakila database, honing my skills in both basic and advanced SQL queries. 🚀

Here's what I accomplished:

🔍 Basic SQL Queries:

Retrieved and analyzed data from various tables like films, actors, and customers.
Filtered data to find specific information, like films released after 2005 or actors who appeared in the most films.
🤝 Joins and Relationships:

Explored relationships between tables to list films with their categories, languages, and the stores managed by staff members.
Analyzed customer data to identify those who haven't rented any films (though I found out all customers have rented!).
🔢 Subqueries and Aggregation:

Used subqueries to find films with ratings above the average, and identified customers who rented films from the "Music" category.
Aggregated data to determine total revenue by category and find the customer with the highest rental duration.
💡 Advanced SQL Topics:

Implemented window functions and advanced queries to calculate metrics like the average rental duration per film and per customer.
Analyzed rental patterns, finding customers who rented the same film more than once, and identifying films rented in the last 7 days.
This project was a great opportunity to sharpen my SQL skills and delve into complex data analysis scenarios. I'm excited to apply these skills to real-world datasets and continue my journey in data analytics!
